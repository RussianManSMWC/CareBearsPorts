# PORTS/REMAKES of Care Bears NES Homebrew
This is a collection of remakes/ports of my [Care Bears NES Homebrew](https://github.com/RussianManSMWC/CareBears) (that was a title screen file select and nothing else) to various platforms.

Why? Because why not. For fun and experience. And I get to try out all these weird engines and stuff. That's cool, right?
